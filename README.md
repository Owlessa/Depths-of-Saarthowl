## :owl: Installation

:warning: :owl: **Depths of Saarthowl requires the full paid Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade.**　:owl: :warning:

:exclamation:　**There will not be a version compatible with older versions of Skyrim.**　:exclamation:

Installing Depths of Saarthowl is super simple and if you have Nexus Premium it's even easier!  

### :owl: Pre-Installation

Before installing Depths of Saarthowl, please complete the following. Or at the very least ensure the below have been done previously.

1. Disable OneDrive and any other programs that may hook into user files.  
2. Change Skyrim settings to not automatically update. In your Steam library, right click Skyrim, Properties, Updates, and choose "Only update this game when I launch it".  
3. Completely uninstall Skyrim. Delete the Steam game folder and the kyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.  
3.1 I repeat, disable OneDrive and any other programs that may hook into user files! Seriously, check again.  
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. If you don't have a folder outside Program files, [try this](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327#default "Info from Steam Support").  
5. Start the game and let it do the graphics check. Settings don't really matter here, everything will be taken care of during installation.  
6. At the main menu let the game install all Creation Club content, this will take a few minutes.  
6.5. Do not alt tab out of the game window! The downloads **will** stop. Just let it run and go grab a coffee/tea/liquid of your choice.  
7. Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes, BitDefender or Webroot. These have been known to mess with the installation process.  


### :owl: Additional Recommended Monitor Setup

I highly recommend taking a few minutes to go over monitor settings and calibrations if you can't remember the last time you have done so.

- Set your graphics card to "Full Range"
	- NVIDIA: Right click on the desktop and go into the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under Display, Change Resolution, 3. Apply the following setting. Choose "Use NVIDIA color settings" and make sure "Output dynamic range: is set to "Full".  
	- AMD: Right click on the desktop and select AMD Radeon Software. Under Display, Pixel Format, choose "Full RGB".  
<!-- I do not have an AMD card, this is just what I found online. I hope it helps! -->

- Calibrate your monitor
	- Start by setting your monitor back to default settings.  
		- This will vary by make and model, please follow the manufacturer's instructions.
	- [Lagom LCD](http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/black.php) is a great resource for calibration. Just focus on the black levels, there are instructions farther down on that page.

### :owl: Installation Time

#### :owl: Installing Wabbajack

After completing the pre-installation steps, download the latest version of Wabbajack from [GitHub](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Extract it to something like `C:\Wabbajack`.  
Do not install it in protected folders, such as program files, on your desktop or in your download folder. These locations will cause issues. It is also recommended to install on an SSD, it will work faster there.
Note: Your downloaded file can be placed on an HDD, but please have Wabbajack and the modlist install be on SSD for a better experience.


#### :owl: Downloading and Installing Depths of Saarthowl

This can take a while depending on your computer and internet connection. Please have patience, even if it doesn't seem like Wabbajack is doing anything at times, it really is.
<!-- Instructions for when it's on the UI -->
<!-- 1. Setup your install and download location. Something like "C:\Games\DoS" would be great.  -->
<!-- 1.1 Do not make these folders on your desktop or in downloads! These locations will cause issues. Again it is recommended to install on the list on an SSD, the game will run smoother there.  -->
<!-- 2. Open Wabbajack and click on the "Browse Modlists" cloud. Make sure to check the "Show Unofficial Lists" checkbox at the top.  -->
<!-- 3. Find the Depths of Saarthowl tile and click on the "Download Modlist" downward arrow. Wait a moment while the install file downloads.  -->
<!-- 4. Set the "Modlist Installation Location" to the folder you setup in step 1.  -->
<!-- 4.1 Make sure that "Modlist Installation Location" and "Resource Download Location" **are different folders**.  -->
<!-- 4.2 The download folder does not have to be on an SSD, it will just work fast there.  -->
<!-- 4.3 By default a resource folder should default to something like "C:\Games\DoS\downloads".  -->
<!-- 4.4 If you install multiple lists it is acceptable and recommended to share a download folder to save space.  -->
<!-- 5. Press the play button to start the process.  -->
<!-- 5.1 If you have Nexus Premium it is just a waiting game!  -->
<!-- 5.2 If you do not, sorry not sorry. There will be a lot of mods to click download for. Put on a movie and do it over the course of a day or two.  -->
<!-- 5.3 Reminder, auto clickers are against the Nexus ToS. Don't do it, just grab a month of premium if you can afford it.  -->
<!-- 6. While Wabbajack is installing, feel free to read through this ReadMe again or check out the FAQ and GameplayChanges.  -->
<!-- 7. Once the install is successful skip down to Post Install!-->
<!-- 7.1 If the install is not successful try the steps under Install Problems.  -->

<!-- Instructions for when it's a downloaded file -->

1. Setup your install and download location. Something like "C:\Games\DoS" would be great.  
1.1 Do not make these folders on your desktop or in downloads! These locations will cause issues. Again it is recommended to install on the list on an SSD, the game will run smoother there.

#### :owl: Install Problems

You may run into problems while using Wabbajack. Don't worry we'll figure it out! Here are a few common problems and solutions.

- Could not download Data_cc...:
	- Anything starting with Data_cc is Creation Club content. Please ensure you have The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade. This is the paid upgrade.
	- If you have purchased the upgrade, launch the game from Steam again, go to Creation Club and selection "Download All"
		- Do not alt-tab out of the game window! This will cause the download to stop fail. Go grab a beverage of your choice, this shouldn't take too long.
	- If you have not, you will need to. DoS is only compatible with the full paid upgrade.
		- The game does go on sale often.
		
<!-- As issues appear put some links to large files -->

- Could not download X:
	- Large files can fail at times. This can be due to Nexus or your internet connection.
	- Either run Wabbajack again or try downloading the problem file and moving it into the download folder set in Wabbajack.

## :owl: Post-Installation


### :owl: Stock Game

Depths of Saarthowl utilizes a Wabbajack feature called Stock Game.  
This creates a copy of your Skyrim install within the modlist. This leaves your Steam folder clean and allows the list to be safe from Steam updates.


### :owl: ENB

Depths of Saarthowl uses [Skies Above Weathers and ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65682 "by Kojak747").  



### :Owl: Customizing the ENB

If you haven't already, please check out the page for [Skies Above Weathers and ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65682 "by Kojak747").

There are many LUTs (Look Up Tables) to choose from. Each will have a different look allowing you to customize the look of your game with just one ENB installed.
 
You can open the ENB GUI by hitting "Shift+Enter". Navigate to "ENBEFFECTPOSTPASSFX" and look for "TECHNIQUE" at the top.  
Comparison gallery by Kojak747 can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/74UKkh9 "images provided by Kojak747").
